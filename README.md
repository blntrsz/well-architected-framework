# AWS Well Architected Framework

## Operational Excellence

1. **Perform operations as code:** Automate operations by defining them as code and using scripting and automation tools.
2. **Annotate documentation:** Keep documentation updated with system changes, using automated and manual processes.
3. **Make frequent, small, reversible changes:** Implement small changes frequently to reduce risk and enable quick recovery.
4. **Refine operations procedures frequently:** Regularly update and improve operational procedures.
5. **Anticipate failure:** Design for failure by testing and planning for various scenarios.
6. **Learn from all operational failures:** Conduct post-mortem analyses to learn from failures and improve systems.

## Security

1. **Implement a strong identity foundation:** Use centralized identity management and enforce least privilege.
2. **Enable traceability:** Monitor and log all actions and changes to resources.
3. **Apply security at all layers:** Use a layered approach to secure resources, applications, and network.
4. **Automate security best practices:** Use automation to enforce security controls and policies.
5. **Protect data in transit and at rest:** Encrypt data and use secure communication protocols.
6. **Prepare for security events:** Have incident response plans and processes in place.

## Reliability

1. **Test recovery procedures:** Regularly test recovery plans and processes.
2. **Automatically recover from failure:** Use automation to detect and respond to issues.
3. **Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability:** Distribute workloads across multiple resources.
4. **Stop guessing capacity:** Use scalable resources and monitor usage to adjust capacity.
5. **Manage change in automation:** Use automation to manage changes to infrastructure and applications.

## Performance Efficiency

1. **Democratize advanced technologies:** Use AWS services to leverage advanced technologies without the need for in-depth expertise.
2. **Go global in minutes:** Deploy applications across multiple regions to serve users globally.
3. **Use serverless architectures:** Utilize serverless computing to improve performance and reduce management overhead.
4. **Experiment more often:** Use AWS resources to quickly prototype and test new ideas.
5. **Mechanical sympathy:** Choose the right tool for the job based on workload requirements.

## Cost Optimization

1. **Adopt a consumption model:** Pay only for the resources you use and scale down when not needed.
2. **Measure overall efficiency:** Use metrics and analytics to understand and optimize costs.
3. **Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting:** Outsource infrastructure management to AWS to focus on business goals.
4. **Analyze and attribute expenditure:** Use cost allocation and tagging to understand and manage costs.
5. **Use managed services to reduce cost of ownership:** Leverage AWS managed services to reduce operational costs.

## Sustainability

1. **Understand your impact:** Measure and understand the environmental impact of your cloud infrastructure.
2. **Establish sustainability goals:** Set clear and measurable sustainability goals.
3. **Maximize utilization:** Optimize resource usage to minimize waste.
4. **Anticipate and adopt new, more efficient technologies:** Stay updated with advancements to use more efficient technologies.
5. **Reduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads:** Design applications to minimize the environmental impact.
6. **Reduce energy consumption:** Use strategies to reduce energy usage in data centers and applications.
